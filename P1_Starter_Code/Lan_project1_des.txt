1/ Description:
This project is a simulation of an ocean world which consists of 
different kinds of entities where each entities has its own unique behaviors.
Following is the list of different entities in this ocean world:

+ Octopus: the mission of each octopus is to catch a certain number of fishes.
Once they have found enough fishes, they will bring those fishes to
a nearest atlantis and then start this process all over again to 
catch as many fishes as possible.

+ Fish: fishes are the target of octopuses. They only appear near 
the area of seagrasses. After appearing for a period of time,
if a fish has not yet to be found by any octopuses, it will transform into a crab.

+ Crab: the mission of crabs is to find and destroy as many seagrasses as possible. 

+ Quake: a quake is created everytime a crab found seagrasses

+ Atlantis: a place where octopuses store their fishes.

+ Seagrass: seagrasses is the target of crabs, and the favorite place of fishes.

The simulation stops once there is no seagrasses.
